/Week 12 - Day 3
Practice What You Learned
Poke Express


Make a Pokemon app that displays data inside server-side rendered views.

Learning Objectives
Practicing index and show, new and create routes with express
Prerequisites
JavaScript
Express
Node
JSX
The User Stories
When a user goes to the /pokemonroute they will see an indexof pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.
When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's showpage, and will see the pokemon's name and image.
Let's Start Catching 'em All!
The User Stories
When a user goes to the /pokemonroute they will see an indexof pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.
When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's showpage, and will see the pokemon's name and image.
When a user goes to /pokemon/newa user sees a form that allows them to create a brand new pokemon, and then redirects the user back to /pokemon
Instructions
Below We will walk you through setting up your app making your first commits and getting started with INDEX and SHOW
NEW and CREATE Will be totally up to you, you won't find any instructions below about how to set them up, it's up to you.
Use your notes from today and your fruits and vegetables app to make the New and Create Routes Correctly.
Set up the file structure
In terminal:

inside your homework folder:

mkdir pokemon_app
cd pokemon_app
mkdir views
touch views/Index.jsx
touch views/Show.jsx
mkdir models
touch models/pokemon.js
touch server.js
touch .gitignore
npm init -y
Approximate File Structure
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"All my files are created"
Install NPM packages
In terminal:

Make sure that you are on the same directory level as your package.json(why?)
npm i express
npm i jsx-view-engine react react-dom
check your package.json
Approximate package.json
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"All my npm packages are added"
Set up your server
-In your server.jsfile, set up your server

require express
set express()to a variable
set a variable of portto 3000
set your app to listen to the port and include a console.log(), so that you can tell when your server is running
include a get route /that will res.send('Welcome to the Pokemon App!');so that when you got to localhost:3000, you will see Welcome to the Pokemon App!
In terminal

nodemonor nodemon server.js(if you set your package.jsonto start server.jsyou do't need to put it after nodemon)

GOTCHA! : nodemonwill only work if you run it from the same location as your package.json
In the browser

go to localhost:3000
check that you have your Welcome to the Pokemon App!message displaying
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"My server is set up and running"
Set up your 'database'
You have created a file called pokemon.js
Inside of this file, put the following array of pokemon objects. This is your 'database' for tonight's homework, copy and paste it as is! You'll notice the image url's are missing something, this is intentional, do not edit anything directly inside the 'database'!
const pokemon = [
			{name: "bulbasaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/bulbasaur"},
			{name: "ivysaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/ivysaur"},
			{name: "venusaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/venusaur"},
			{name: "charmander", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charmander"},
			{name: "charizard", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charizard"},
			{name: "squirtle", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/squirtle"},
			{name: "wartortle", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/wartortle"}
		 ];
Set up your 'database' so that it can be exported to your server.jsand then be required by your server.js
Set this 'database' to a variable called pokemonin your server.jsfile
Create a get route /pokemonthat will res.send(pokemon), which will display your pokemon data as json in the browser
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"Connected my database, can see json in the browser"
Set up your index view
Instead of displaying json at your /pokemonroute, you should serve the Index.jsxfile you created that will display your pokemon
You will have to set up your jsx file

Start with your html boilerplate code
Add an <h1>that describes this page, i.e. 'See All The Pokemon!'
Try adding some inline styles:
We can add inline CSS, which are specified as attributes and are passed to the elements. These are specified as an object with a key as camelCased style name & value being the actual style value (and not as a string).

const myStyle = {
color: '#ffffff',
backgroundColor: '#000000',
};

class MyFirstComponent extends React.Component() {
return (
  <div style={myStyle}>My First React Component!</div>;
}
}
Change your /pokemonroute to res.renderyour Index.jsxfile
In your browser, go to localhost:3000/pokemonand be sure to see your Index.jsxview with an h1tag
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"index.jsx view rendered at pokemon route"
Set up your index view to show your pokemon data
Continue working on your Index.jsxview so that you can see:

The name of each pokemon, as a list item, inside an unordered list
This list should be dynamically rendered by jsx based on your data from your 'database'
You'll notice the pokemon names aren't properly capitalized! Let's fix that! Manipulate the data programatically to capitalize the first letter of their names
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"I can view a list of all my pokemon in the browser"
Setting up your show route
Inside your server.js, add a new get route /pokemon/:id
That will res.send(req.params.id);
So, when you go to localhost:3000/pokemon/whatever
whateverwill show up in the browser
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"Show view shows req.params.id "
Link your Index.jsxto your Show.jsx
Inside your Index.jsx,

For each pokemon, add an <a>tag that will have an hrefthat goes to the route /pokemon/x, where x is the array position of the pokemonin the data array. This should be set dynamically with jsx
When you click the link you should go to your show route and the index number corresponding to the pokemon's array position should be displayed
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"Added dynamic anchor tags to index.jsx "
Render your individual pokemon in the show view
Copy/paste your code from your Index.jsxinto your Sshow.jsx`
Change all your html code inside your Show.jsxfile so that

Your h1 tag says "Gotta Catch 'Em All"
Add an h2 tag that will display the name of the pokemon
Add an image tag that will display an image of the pokemon
Add an anchor tag with the text of back, that will take you back to your Index.jsxview
Update the route in the server.js to render the show view with the pokemon data
Oh no! The image is broken because in our database the image links don't have the .jpgending, let's fix that programatically! Without going back to the database and editing it there, add on .jpgto the end of the pokemon's image data
ðŸ”´ Commit:
"Created show views of each pokemon"
Part 2 with Pokedex
Add Model for pokemon
Rewrite Index Route to use Mongodb
Rewrite Index View to work with Index Route
Rewrite Show Route to MongoDB
Rewrite Create Route to work with MongoDB
Use New Page to create all the pokemon that were in the original array at minimum
